# ServeManager API Client

An implementation of the [Serve Manager](https://www.servemanager.com) [API](https://www.servemanager.com/api) in Java.

This client is a third-party implementation and is not supported by ServeManager.

## Requirements

servemanager-client requires Java 8+

Although this project is open source, ServeManager is a commercial product and you will need a valid API key to use this client. [Contact ServeManager](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UVVbn1a_FU3YsHdFv8sRES9jomyW_ZAYMeYL3Jxo498/viewform?usp=send_form) for more information.

## Installing

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.greenfiling.smclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>servemanager-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.16</version>
</dependency>
```

## Logging

The library logs via [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/). What logging actually takes place is up to your project's actual logging configuration.

## License

## Usage Details

This implementation follows the [API documentation](https://www.servemanager.com/api) very closely. Each documented API endpoint (Account, Employees, Jobs, etc) has a dedicated class (AccountClient, EmployeeClient, JobClient), and each class implements the documented methods (show, index, update, or create). With a few exceptions, these methods are the only way to interact with the API.

#### Instantiating

There are two steps to being able to interact with the API. The first is getting an ApiHandle. This contains non-endpoint-specific information for communicating with the API, including API key, URL, and timeouts (see the `ApiHandle` class for all settings). The only element required to instantiate is the API key. ApiHandle uses a builder pattern:

```java
ApiHandle apiHandle = new ApiHandle.Builder()
                          .apiKey(VALID_API_KEY)
                          .build();
```

Once an ApiHandle is created, it can be used to create the individual endpoint clients:

```java
JobClient client = new JobClient(apiHandle);
```

While more than one ApiHandle can be created, typically only one is needed for an application (though see Transactions in the Debugging section below). Similarly, there's not really any reason to create more than one client endpoint object per application.

#### Data Model

The data model hews strongly to the documentation. Each endpoint has a dedicated read object matching the read and index documentation (e.g., `Job` for `JobClient`), and some have a submit object. There are also support objects that do not match endpoint definitions but are needed to create the object in Java. For instance, there is a LineItem class.

There are two container classes used to wrap the endpoint object, `Show<>` and `Index<>`. `Show<>` is the wrapper for a single object, accessible via `.getData()`. `Index<>` is the wrapper for a list of objects, as returned by the `index()` interface, and `.getData()` returns an array of objects.

#### Reading (show)

```java
JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Show<Job> resp = jobClient.show(123);

System.out.println("Job Number: " + resp.getData().getServeManagerJobNumber());
System.out.println("Documents for download: ");
for (Document d : resp.getData().getDocuments()) {
  System.out.println(" - " + d.getPdfDownloadUrl());
}
```

#### Listing (index)

```java
JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Index<Job> resp = jobClient.index();

System.out.println("Number of jobs in response: " + resp.getData().size());
System.out.println("ServeManager Job Numbers: ");
for (Job j : resp.getData()) {
  System.out.println(" - " + j.getServeManagerJobNumber());
}
```

##### Pagination

For clients that support the `index()` method, there is also a way to handle pagination relatively easily. `getNext(Index<>)` takes either the response to the initial `index()` request or the last `getNext()` call. Any filtering is done in the initial `index()` request and does not need to be specified to subsequent `getNext()` calls. `getNext()` will return a new `Index<>` object representing the next page of results or `null` if there are no more results.

```java
JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);

Index<Job> resp = jobClient.index();
Integer pages = 0;
Integer total = 0;
while (resp != null) {
  pages++;
  total += resp.getData().size();
  resp = client.getNext(resp);
}
System.out.println(total + " total objects returned across " + pages + " pages");
```

#### Creating (create)

The create() and update() interfaces use a specific representation of the object to be created that is distinct from the read-version (for instance, JobSubmit instead of Job). This object matches the layout for updating and creating detailed for each interface in the API documentation. However, create() and update() can also accept the regular read object, which will then be converted. It is up to the user. The trade-off is that the "Submit" version of the objects require understanding a different format, while the read version of the objects are slightly more complex to build with all the information required.

```java
JobSubmit job = new JobSubmit();
job.setCourtCaseId(1234);
job.setRush(true);
job.setDueDate(LocalDate.parse("2021-11-15"));

JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Show<Job> createdJob = jobClient.create(job);
System.out.println("New job " + createdJob.getData().getId() + " visible at " + createdJob.getData().getLinks().getSelf());
```

#### Updating (update)

See create section above for additional background. Only fields that you want to be changed should be populated.

```java
JobSubmit job = new JobSubmit();
job.setRush(true);

JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Show<Job> createdJob = jobClient.update(1234, job);
System.out.println("Job " + createdJob.getData().getId() + " updated, new rush = " + createdJob.getData().getRush());
```

#### Uploading Files

create() and update() can allow you to upload a file. See the relevant [API section](https://www.servemanager.com/api/#overview-uploads) for how this works at a low level. This client gives a convenient way to upload a file to ServeManager's temporary URL without needing to know many specifics.

See also `ServiceDocument.externalUrl` in the "Client Implementation vs. API Documentation Differences" at the end of this document.

```java
JobSubmit newJob = new JobSubmit();
job.setCourtCaseId(1234);
job.setRush(true);
job.setDueDate(LocalDate.parse("2021-11-15"));

ArrayList<ServiceDocument> docs = new ArrayList<ServiceDocument>();
ServiceDocument doc = new ServiceDocument();
doc.setTitle("Subpoena");
doc.setReceivedAt(OffsetDateTime.now());
doc.setFileName("file_name.pdf");
docs.add(doc);
job.setDocumentsToBeServedAttributes(docs);

JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Show<Job> resp = client.create(job);

// Perform the actual file upload to the temporary URL provided by the API
ServiceDocument docObj = resp.getData().getDocumentsToBeServed().get(0);
jobClient.completeUpload(docObj.getUpload(), "application/pdf", new File("/path/to/file_name.pdf"));
```

#### Filtering

Only a few of the interfaces support filtering options on the index() calls (Company, CourtCase, and Job). Each of these interfaces has a dedicated filter object that defined the filtering information to provide to the API. The exact details of what can go into a filter are listed in the API documentation.

```java
// Create a job filter that lists all jobs that have the test foobar in them and were created after October 1, 2021
JobFilter jobFilter = new JobFilter();
jobFilter.setDateRange(new FilterDateRange());
jobFilter.getDateRange().setType(FilterDateRange.TYPE_CREATED_AT);
jobFilter.getDateRange().setMin(OffsetDateTime.parse("2021-10-01T00:00:00-00:00"));
jobFilter.setQ("foobar");

JobClient jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Index<Job> resp = jobClient.index(filter);

System.out.println("Matching jobs:");
while (resp != null) {
  for (Job j : resp.getData()) {
    System.out.println(" - JobId: " + j.getId() + ", URL = " + j.getLinks().getSelf());
  }
  resp = jobClient.getNext(resp);
}
```

#### Notes

The Notes interface is unique among the ServeManager endpoints. There are three functions to be done with notes: (1) create a new note, (2) list all of the notes associated with a Job, and (3) list all existing notes. Only (3) uses the /notes endpoint. (1) and (2) are actually performed through the /jobs endpoint. This API tries to follow the principle that regardless of the action, they should exist in the correct Client class for the endpoint being accessed. As such, the listing of all notes is performed via NoteClient, but per-job listing and note creation are done via JobClient.

```java
noteClient = new NoteClient(apiHandle);
Index<Note> resp = client.index();
System.out.println("There are " + resp.getData().size() + " total notes (or possibly more if it was paginated)");
```

```java
jobClient = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Integer jobId = 111111;

Note note = new Note();
note.setLabel("Job Details");
note.setBody("this is the body");
note.setJobId(jobId);

Show<Note> createResponse = jobClient.createNote(note);
System.out.println("created note id = " + createResponse.getData().getId());

Index<Note> indexResponse = jobClient.indexNotes(jobId);
System.out.println("Number of notes after create: " + indexResponse.getData().size() + " (or possibly more if it was paginated)");
```

#### Constants

The API documentation lists many string constants that can be passed to the API as valid values (listed under "Enumerated Attributes" under each endpoint that has them). Some of these are complete, meaning that using any other value will result in an error, but others define a list of standard values but say that custom values are allowed. While a Java `enum` would work for the former, it would not work for the latter. For simplicity, string constants are provided internally for each value defined in the API documentation. Each set method which could accept one of these values have javadoc which defines the available constants. While these constants do not have to be used, their use will make maintaining client code easier.

As an example, under Jobs the `data['recipient']['gender']` values are set to "", "Male", "Female", and "Other". The javadoc for Recipient.setGender(), the constants GENDER_BLANK, GENDER_MALE, GENDER_FEMALE, and GENDER_OTHER are listed.

Example of how this would be set in live code:

```java
 JobSubmit newJob = new JobSubmit();
 Recipient recipient = new Recipient();
 recipient.setGender(Recipient.GENDER_MALE);
 newJob.setRecipientAttributes(recipient);
```

#### Downloading Files

The ApiHandle class offers two methods for downloading files from URLs, `doGetFile()` and `doGetFileApi()`. Every client class also inherits convenience interfaces to these methods, `getFile()` and `getFileApi()`. These two methods are equivalent; `apiHandle.doGetFile(url, file);` and `jobClient.getFile(url, file);` are identical.

The `doGetFile()` method is for downloading arbitrary files. This action has nothing to do with the ServeManager API, but is provided as a convenience since it is useful for downloading documents referenced by the API.

```java
JobClient client = new JobClient(apiHandle);
Show<Job> resp = client.show(8624870);

ServiceDocument doc = resp.getData().getDocumentsToBeServed().get(0);
String localPath = System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") + "/" + doc.getUpload().getFileName();
String url = doc.getUpload().getLinks().getDownloadUrl();

client.getFile(url, localPath);
System.out.println("Downloaded from " + url);
System.out.println("Downloaded to " + localPath);
```

The `doGetFileApi()` method is for downloading files that require API authentication to access. It behaves identically, it just ensures that API credentials are added to the call. Notably, while most objects present a URL that does not require authentication, the Document object (which is used to return affidavits related to the job) uses URLs which present as part of the API and require authentication.

```java
Document affidavit = job.getDocuments().get(0);
String url = affidavit.getPdfDownloadUrl();
String localPath = System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") + "/" + affidavit.getId().toString() + ".pdf";

client.getFileApi(url, localPath);
System.out.println("Downloaded from " + url);
System.out.println("Downloaded to " + localPath);
```

#### Debugging

As mentioned above, the library logs via [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/). If the slf4j is to log level `trace` either via a scope (for instance, com.greenfiling.smclient) or globally, extremely detailed request and response logs will be made.

To gain access to this information programmatically, see the `Transaction` class. You can gain detailed information about both sides of a request/response pair. The number of transactions to keep in memory is tuneable via the `keepTransactions()` method in the `ApiHandle` builder class. The transactions themselves can be accessed via `ApiHandle.getTransactions()`. Because it is likely that the ApiHandle and a client might be far apart in an application, there is a convenience accessor vie the getTransactions() method on all `*Client` classes. The transactions are members of the ApiHandle, which means that if you use the same ApiHandle to instantiate multiple clients, the client transactions will co-mingle in the handle.

#### Error Handling

The error handling in this client is all Exception based. While the examples above were all written without it for the sake of clarity, all calls into the client should be wrapper in `try` blocks, and all values returned by the client should be checked for null values before attempting to dereference.

#### Client Implementation vs. API Documentation Differences

The design of the client hews very close to the API documentation, with a few exceptions

- API field `attempts.servemanager_job_number` is represented in the client as `Attempt.serveManagerJobNumber` (note that Manager is capitalized, which is closer to what Java programmers would expect).
- API field `courts.default` is represented in the client as `Court.isDefault` to work around `default` being a Java reserved word.
- API field `jobs.servemanager_job_number` is represented in the client as `Job.serveManagerJobNumber` (note that Manager is capitalized, which is closer to what Java programmers would expect).
- API field `jobs.affidavit_count` is represented in the client as `Job.documentsCount` to match the `jobs.documents` field to which it refers.
- API field `jobs.document_to_be_served_count` is represented in the client as `Job.documentsToBeServedCount`, pluralizing "documents" to match that of the `jobs.documents_to_be_served` field to which it refers.
- API field `jobs.attempt_count` is represented in the client as `Job.attemptsCount`, pluralizing "attempts" to match that of the `jobs.attempts` field to which it refers.
- When creating or updating a job, the documented way of uploading documents is to specify the existence of the documents in the create, then use a raw PUT to post the file. This is simplified by the `JobClient.completeUpload()` smclient method. It can be further simplified by using the undocumented `ServiceDocument.externalUrl` member. When this is set on a ServiceDocument object that is being passed to ServeManager during a `create()`, ServeManager will pull the file contents from that URL and save it without needing an extra step from the client.
