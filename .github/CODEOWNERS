# Defining Code Owners for GreenFiling.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners. These owners will
# be the default owners for everything in the repo. Unless a later match takes
# precedence.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default to everything being owned by devteam
